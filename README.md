# Time-Series
The purpose of this project is to go through techniques and tools in Python for machine learning with time-series. I'm following the book "Machine Learning for Time-Series with Python", author Ben Auffarth, Packt Publishing, to learn different techniques in machine learning, and to implement them in practise using the examples in the book.
